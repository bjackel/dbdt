Following http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9082499/custom-domain-for-github-project-pages
went to registrar
Log in to your Control Panel.
Go to Domain Central.
Click on the domain you want to edit.
Click DNS.
Use the Modify drop-down to select the type of DNS record you want to modify:
  Private Nameserver
  MX Record
  CNAME Alias
  NS Record
  A Record
  TXT/SPF Record
  
dbdt.org  192.30.252.153
dbdt.org  192.30.252.154
and remove

dbdt.org 66.96.160.131
add CNAME
www bjackel.github.io

back to github, create CNAME file at project root containing "dbdt.org" 

But no joy.  Maybe try again tomorrow?

Wait a minute, www.dbdt.org gives "there isn't a githup pages site heree"
